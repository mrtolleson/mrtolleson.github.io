Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am an agricultural research professional who freelances in data analytics. I believe improving our agricultural practices is the best way to solve most of the world's problems. I also believe many of our problems could be solved by getting involved in your community. These beliefs guide my professional and personal life.

### My qualifications are:
Ms in Plant Breeding and Genetics, Texas A&M University: pending thesis defense
Bsc in Plant and Environmental Soil Science, Texas A&M University: 2017
Occupational Skills Award in Business Management from North Central Texas College: pending final course

Six years as a research professional in plant breeding
Three years as an agricultural extension educator
One year of international development experience

### Some of my projects are:
[Google Data Analytics Bellabeat Project](https://github.com/mrtolleson/Bellabeat-Case/blob/main/Bellabeat%20Summary.md)
This was my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics certification. Instead of finding a couple of correlations and plotting them to demonstrate I know how to use ggplot, I tried to answer the business question at hand: what features can the Bellabeat company sell?
